  # Also automatically added by GitHubâ€™s Pages integration:
  # job that actually deploys the artifact to GitHub Pages
  # So you might see something like "report-build-status" or "deploy" in your existing file
  # Keep them as is, or adapt them if you want to rename.
  # Just ensure they run after the build job and also have the 'schedule:' in `on:`.
